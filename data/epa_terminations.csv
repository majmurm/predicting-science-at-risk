AS WE SEEK TO REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON POLLUTING FOSSIL FUEL SOURCES, THE DEPLOYMENT OF DISTRIBUTED SOLAR AMONG THESE SECTORS HAS BECOME A VALUABLE STRATEGY IN OUR NATION'S ENERGY TRANSITION. WHEN CONSIDERING THE ASSOCIATED COMMUNITY BENEFITS, HOWEVER, ONE SECTOR OF SOCIETY ARGUABLY BENEFITS MOST - THE EDUCATIONAL SECTOR. SCHOOLS, LIKE OTHER INSTITUTIONS, BUSINESSES, AND HOMES, EXPERIENCE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL BENEFITS WHEN SOLAR TECHNOLOGY IS ADOPTED, BUT THE CASE FOR SOLAR ON SCHOOL PROPERTIES BECOMES PARTICULARLY COMPELLING WHEN ASSOCIATED EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE CONSIDERED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN LOW INCOME AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES WHERE SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN UNDER RESOURCED AND WHERE ACCESS TO CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY IS OFTEN UNAVAILABLE.

THIS SOLAR FOR SCHOOLS INITIATIVE WILL PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO FIVE NORTHEAST OHIO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES TO COLLECTIVELY INSTALL BETWEEN 600 - 800 KW OF SOLAR, WILL CREATE A PROCUREMENT FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE SOLAR INSTALLATIONS, AND WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CURRICULUM FOR K-12 SCIENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL CAREER TECH STUDENTS.

THE GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE TO: REDUCE ELECTRICITY COSTS FOR SCHOOLS; REDUCE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS; INCREASE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CLEAN, LOCAL RENEWABLE ENERGY; PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL AND CAREER TECH OPPORTUNITIES FOR K-12 STUDENTS; AND CREATE A REPLICABLE PROCUREMENT MODEL.

THE PROJECT WILL PRODUCE LASTING OUTCOMES BY DEMONSTRATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS OF SOLAR, BY CREATING A 'SOLAR FOOTPRINT' THAT CAN BE BUILT UPON, AND BY DEVELOPING A STANDARD PROCUREMENT PROCESS THAT CAN BE REPLICATED IN THE FUTURE.ACTIVITIES:(1) THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) DEVELOPMENT AND ISSUANCE: SOLAR UNITED NEIGHBORS WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE OHIO SCHOOLS COUNCIL AND THE IBEW LOCAL 38 TO DEVELOP THE SOLAR INSTALLER RFP. THE RFP WILL INCLUDE LIVING WAGE RATE AND APPRENTICESHIP REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS DEI CONSIDERATIONS. RESPONDENTS WILL BE ASKED TO DESCRIBE THEIR PAST EFFORTS WITH REGARD TO HIRING AND PROMOTING DIVERSE EMPLOYEES AND IMPLEMENTING EQUITABLE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS.

(2) INSTALLER SELECTION: THE OHIO SCHOOLS COUNCIL WILL WORK WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH DISTRICT AND THE IBEW TO SELECT A SOLAR INSTALLER. APPLICANTS WILL BE EVALUATED BASED ON PRICING, EQUIPMENT, AND WARRANTY OFFERINGS AS WELL AS EMPLOYEE DIVERSITY, COMPETITIVE WAGES FOR EMPLOYEES, AND FAIR HIRING PRACTICES. PREFERENCE WILL BE GIVEN TO AN INSTALLER WITH A LOCAL PRESENCE THAT UTILIZES A LOCAL WORKFORCE.

(3) INSTALLATION AND INTERCONNECTION: SOLAR ARRAYS WILL BE INSTALLED ON SELECTED SCHOOLS WITHIN THE FIVE PARTNER DISTRICTS.

(4) ONGOING MONITORING: SOLAR UNITED NEIGHBORS AND CUYAHOGA COUNTY WILL WORK WITH THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MONITOR SOLAR ENERGY PRODUCTION, CARBON EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS, AND ELECTRICITY BILL SAVINGS THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE GRANT.

(5) K-12 CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT: CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS FROM THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE CENTER WILL COLLABORATE WITH ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS FROM EACH DISTRICT TO DEVELOP A K-12 RENEWABLE ENERGY CURRICULUM. CURRICULUM WILL INCLUDE FOUNDATIONAL INSTRUCTION ON CLIMATE SCIENCE, WILL INCORPORATE THE VALUE OF SCHOOL SOLAR INSTALLATIONS, AND WILL EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES IN OUR NATION'S ENERGY TRANSITION. CURRICULUM WILL BE DEVELOPED OVER A 2-WEEK PERIOD DURING THE SUMMER OF 2024.

(6) RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTINUING EDUCATION SERIES FOR TEACHERS: THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE CENTER (ESC) WILL OFFER A MONTHLY CONTINUING EDUCATION SERIES FOR TEACHERS DURING THE FALL AND SPRING SEMESTERS.

OUR PROJECT LEVERAGES EXISTING DATA FROM EPA'S SIX-YEAR REVIEW OF DRINKING WATER STANDARDS, AS WELL AS OTHER SOURCES THAT ARE UNDER-EXPLORED BY ECONOMISTS. EPA'S EX ANTE REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS (RIA) SUGGESTED THAT THE RULE'S MONETIZED BENEFITS DID NOT EXCEED ITS COSTS (ABT ASSOCIATES, INC. 2000), WHICH (ALONG WITH POLITICAL TIMING) MADE IT THE SUBJECT OF PUBLIC CONTROVERSY.

THIS PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A VERY THIN LITERATURE ON THE ECONOMICS OF THE SDWA. LACK OF INFORMATION IN THE PEER-REVIEWED LITERATURE ON THE ACT'S HEALTH AND OTHER BENEFITS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO CRITIQUES ON THE BASIS OF COST, ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL COMMUNITIES (BELZER 2020). THEIR WORK WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF RELATIVELY LOW BENEFIT-COST RATIOS FOR WATER  QUALITY RULES RELATIVE TO AIR QUALITY RULES IN THE UNITED STATES (KEISER ET AL. 2019). ONE REASON  FOR THE THIN ECONOMICS LITERATURE ON THE SDWA IS THAT, UNTIL RECENTLY, THE ONLY AVAILABLE DATA FOR  ASSESSING REGULATORY IMPACTS WERE VIOLATIONS DATA. THESE DATA HAVE BEEN USED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT  SDWA VIOLATIONS MAY INCREASE HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES (ALZAHRANI ET AL. 2020) AND INDUCE BOTTLED  WATER PURCHASES (GRAFF ZIVIN ET AL. 2011), AND THAT THE SDWA'S INFORMATION DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT  HAS REDUCED VIOLATIONS, PARTICULARLY OF MICROBIAL STANDARDS (BAKER ET AL. 2023, BENNEAR AND OLMSTEAD  2008). VIOLATIONS ARE INFREQUENT, HOWEVER, AND THEY ARE A NOISY MEASURE OF WATER QUALITY CONCERNS. 
TO QUANTIFY THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF MCLS UNDER THE SDWA, DATA CAPTURING SPATIAL AND INTERTEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE ACTUAL CONTAMINANT LEVELS IN PUBLIC DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS ARE NEEDED.

THEY WILL RECONSIDER THE BENEFITS AND THE COSTS OF THE ARSENIC RULE EX POST AND COMPARE OUR RESULTS TO THE EPA'S EX ANTE RIA (ABT ASSOCIATES, INC. 2000). THEIR BENEFITS COMPARISON WILL USE A MULTI-STEP PROCESS THAT ALLOWS US TO DEMONSTRATE HOW SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF NEW INFORMATION AFFECT OUR ESTIMATES OF THE RULE'S EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH OUTCOMES. FOR COST ESTIMATES, THEY WILL CONSULT NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE LITERATURE ON THE COSTS OF THE ARSENIC RULE, UPDATING THOSE AS NECESSARY (MORGAN AND SIMON 2014). FINALLY, THEY WILL CONSIDER HOW COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE STANDARD MAY HAVE DIFFERENTIALLY ACCRUED TO SMALL COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS WATER SYSTEMS PRIMARILY SERVING LOW-INCOME AND MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS.

ACTIVITIES:THE RESEARCH PROJECT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION AND PERFORM A SERIES OF ANALYSES OF THE DATA.  THEY INCLUDE:

TO ESTIMATE THE BENEFITS OF THE ARSENIC RULE, THE RESEARCHERS WILL USE SDWA COMPLIANCE SAMPLES FROM 1980 TO 2011. WE ASSEMBLE THESE SAMPLES FROM THREE SOURCES: THE OCCURRENCE ANALYSIS FOR THE RULE ITSELF, THE SIX YEAR REVIEW 2, AND THE SIX YEAR REVIEW #3. THESE DATA INCLUDE SAMPLE INFORMATION FROM 25, 45, AND 48 STATES OVER THE PERIODS 1980-2000, 1998-2005, AND 2006-2011, RESPECTIVELY.

THE RESEARCHERS WILL ALSO COLLECT AMBIENT AS CONCENTRATIONS FROM SOURCE WATER IN RIVERS, STREAMS AND AQUIFERS FROM THE WATER QUALITY PORTAL (WQP), AN ONLINE PLATFORM THAT COLLECTS SAMPLING DATA FROM 900 FEDERAL, STATE, AND OTHER AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE US EPA AND USGS. WE MATCH AS MONITORING STATIONS WITH DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HYDROLOGIC UNIT CODE (HUC)12 WATERSHED WHERE BOTH THE MONITORING STATION AND THE DRINKING WATER INTAKE ARE LOCATED.

HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO ARSENIC IN DRINKING WATER, INCLUDE CANCERS OF THE BLADDER, LUNG, SKIN, KIDNEY, NASAL PASSAGES, LIVER, AND PROSTATE (ABT ASSOCIATES, INC. 2000).

THIS BIFURCATED AWARDS PROCESS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED BY EPA TO ENSURE THAT THE GRANTMAKERS HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY GRANTMAKING INFRASTRUCTURE BEFORE BEGINNING TO ISSUE SUBGRANTS. THE EJ TCGM PROGRAM IS A KEY LEVER TO ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE CENTRAL REGIONS WHILE ENSURING THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN SHAPE THE PROCESS.ACTIVITIES:RTI INTERNATIONAL AND ITS PARTNERS WILL COME TOGETHER TO SERVE AS THE REGION 4 AND NATIONAL-CENTRAL GRANTMAKERS. ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED DURING THIS PROJECT ARE:

1) RTI WILL WORK, IN CONSULTATION WITH EPA REGIONAL LEADERS AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES, TO IDENTIFY AND ENGAGE THREE (3) NEW STATUTORY PARTNERS LOCATED WITHIN REGION 7 TO ENSURE TCGM PROVIDES DIRECT SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE REGION. 

2) RTI INTERNATIONAL WILL IMPLEMENT THE COMMUNITY-ENGAGED TRANSFORMATIVE GOVERNANCE MODEL TO SUPPORT THE TYPE OF DECISION-MAKING THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DEFINE SUCCESS FOR THEIR PROJECTS, DECIDE ON THE TYPE OF INTERVENTIONS THEY MOST NEED, AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE GRANTMAKING PROCESS. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARDS (CABS) ARE THE CORNERSTONE OF THE PROGRAM. WHILE APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED ON A ROLLING BASIS, CABS WILL MEET TO MAKE FUNDING DECISIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THEY ARE ALSO CHARGED WITH GUIDING THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION WITHIN THE REGIONS.  IN CONSULTATION WITH EPA REGIONAL LEADERS, TCGM PARTNERS, AND COMMUNITY MEMBER INPUT, RTI WILL DEVELOP SELECTION CRITERIA TO SELECT COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD (CAB) MEMBERS. RTI WILL WORK CLOSELY TO ENSURE THAT SELECTION FOR CAB MEMBERS CONSIDERS CONTEXTUAL EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS SO THAT THE TCGM PROGRAM CAN SERVE THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT IT IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT.

RTI WILL IMPLEMENT AND DEPLOY FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO INSTILL RESILIENCE TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES INCLUSIVE OF REGIONS 4, 5, 6 AND 7.

THIS FUNDING IS THE LATTER HALF OF THE BIFURCATED AWARD THAT WILL BE USED FOR PASSTHROUGH GRANTMAKING ACTIVITIES AUTHORIZED UNDER CAA 138(B). THE RTI NATIONAL GRANTMAKER (CENTRAL REGIONS) WILL BE FUNDED BY THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT (IRA) APPROPRIATIONS AT THE LEVEL TOTALING $120 MILLION AND DIVIDED INTO TWO AWARDS. THE INITIAL AWARD OF $25 MILLION WAS MADE IN AUGUST 2024 AND THE SUBSEQUENT AWARD OF $95 MILLION IS SLATED FOR DECEMBER 2024. THE BIFURCATED AWARD IS SOURCED FROM THE SAME FUNDING BUT WILL MAINTAIN SEPARATE BUT OVERLAPPING TIMELINES TO MEET THE OVERALL COMPONENTS OF THE AWARD. THE SUBSEQUENT AWARD INCLUDES AWARD COMPETITION, SELECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS, CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR REGIONAL GRANTMAKERS AND SUBRECIPIENTS, PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE AND OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE REGIONAL GRANTMAKERS IN 4,5,6, AND 7 AS WELL AS ADDRESSING COVERAGE GAPS THAT THEY MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY REACHING. GAPS INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, REMOTE AND/OR RURAL AREAS OF THE U.S. TERRITORIES AND PARTS OF THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES. 

OEJECR HAS ALSO PROVIDED ADDITIONAL WITHIN-SCOPE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR EACH GRANTMAKER TO ADDRESS  QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA), HUMAN SUBJECTS REVIEW (HSR), AS WELL AS PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL MEANINGFUL OUTREACH AND GAP FILLING TO REMOTE, RURAL AND HARD-TO-REACH AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, AND TERRITORIES THAT MUST BE ADJUSTED DUE TO ELEVATED TRAVEL COSTS. SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS TOTAL  $20M OF THE $95 MILLION AND WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL DISTRIBUTION AND COMPLETION PROJECTS FUNDED UNDER THE SUBAWARDS.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE INITIAL AWARD ENABLED THE GRANTMAKER TO PERFORM THE TASKS NEEDED TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT PROPOSED PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE, OUTREACH, AND SYSTEM MOBILIZATION EFFORTS THAT ESTABLISHED THE CRITERIA FOR THE COLLECTION, REVIEW, SELECTION, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EJ THRIVING COMMUNITIES SUBAWARDS. THE PASS-THROUGH MODEL DEVELOPED BY EPA IS CENTRAL TO THE NEW APPROACH, AS IT  ALLOWS THE GRANTMAKERS TO DISTRIBUTE SMALLER SUBAWARDS TO COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS (CBOS) MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THE TRADITIONAL FEDERAL GRANTS PROCESS. THIS MODEL WILL ENDEAVOR TO ENSURE THAT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES CAN ACCESS FUNDS MORE QUICKLY AND WITH FEWER ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS. THE WORK PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED UNDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM WILL BE MANAGED BY GRANTMAKERS WHILE ALLOWING EPA TO FOCUS ON ASSESSMENT, PLANNING, AND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT.

RTI HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN GRANTMAKING AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR EQUITY-CENTERED APPROACHES THAT BUILD COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENTALLY BASED OUTCOMES AND WILL ENDEAVOR TO ENSURE THAT EPA FUNDS UNDER THE THRIVING COMMUNITY GRANTMAKER PROGRAM ARE MANAGED AND DISTRIBUTED TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IN NEED OF ADDRESSING HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES.

AS PART OF THE IRA LEGISLATION, OEJECR ALSO RECEIVED $200 MILLION TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ELIGIBLE ENTITIES, AS DEFINED IN CAA SECTION 138, RELATED TO ANY GRANTS MADE FROM THE $3 BILLION APPROPRIATION. $20 MILLION OF THIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS BEING USED TO ESTABLISH AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT WITH AMERICORPS TO CREATE THE CLEAN ENVIRONMENT CORPS (CEC) VISTA PROGRAM. OF THIS $20 MILLION, $13 MILLION WILL BE SENT TO AMERICORPS VIA AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT AND $7 MILLION WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO RTI AS A NONCOMPETITIVE AWARD ISSUED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SERVING AS THE INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR FOR ALL THE GRANTMAKERS. PROJECT ACTIVITIES DISCUSSED IN THIS FUNDING RECOMMENDATION WILL PRIMARILY FOCUS ON THOSE COVERED UNDER THE $7 MILLION NONCOMPETITIVE AWARD TO RTI.  
ACTIVITIES:VISTA MEMBERS WITH THE CEC ('CEC VISTA MEMBERS') PROGRAM WILL BE EMBEDDED WITH THE REGIONAL AND NATIONAL GRANTMAKERS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES APPLYING FOR AND RECEIVING FUNDING THROUGH TCGM. THE AMERICORPS - TCGM PARTNERSHIP WILL SUPPORT APPROXIMATELY/UP TO 260 CEC VISTA MEMBERS AND APPROXIMATELY/UP TO 6 CEC VISTA LEADERS OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. MEMBERS OF THE CEC VISTA PROGRAM WILL ALSO BE CONSIDERED MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN CLIMATE CORPS, AN INITIATIVE TO PROVIDE AMERICANS WITH PATHWAYS TO HIGH-QUALITY, GOOD-PAYING CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE JOBS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS AFTER THEY COMPLETE THEIR YEAR OF SERVICE. 

THE EPA AND AMERICORPS DECIDED THAT ONE NATIONAL GRANTMAKER WILL SERVE AS THE INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE ENTIRE CEC PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF ALL THE GRANTMAKERS (BOTH REGIONAL AND NATIONAL). CENTRALIZING THE ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CEC PROGRAM WITH ONE NATIONAL GRANTMAKER, RATHER THAN USING ALL THREE NATIONAL GRANTMAKERS, CREATES ECONOMIES OF SCALE FOR RECRUITMENT AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS PROCESS STANDARDIZATION FOR THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. THE INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR WILL WORK WITH AMERICORPS, THE OTHER GRANTMAKERS, AND ANY PARTNERS TO THE GRANTMAKERS TO IMPLEMENT THE CEC PROGRAM. SECOND, THE INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR WILL APPLY TO AMERICORPS TO IMPLEMENT A VISTA PROJECT, THEREBY CREATING LESS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR AMERICORPS. THIRD, THE INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR WILL RECRUIT, MANAGE, AND PLACE APPROXIMATELY/UP TO 260 CEC VISTA MEMBERS WITH 11 GRANTMAKERS AND THEIR PARTNERS. LASTLY, THE INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR WILL IDENTIFY PLACEMENTS FOR CEC VISTA MEMBERS AND ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH GRANTMAKERS AND PARTNERS TO HOST THEM. ONCE THESE PLACEMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR WILL DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A RECRUITMENT PROCESS FOR ALL CEC VISTA MEMBERS IN COORDINATION WITH AMERICORPS AND HOSTS. THE INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR WILL ALSO MANAGE THE PROGRAMMATIC, FINANCIAL, AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CEC PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHER HOSTS.

AS CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO INCREASE THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF EXTREME HEAT ACROSS THE WESTERN UNITED STATES, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR ADAPTATION RESOURCES AND PLANNING GUIDANCE IN CALIFORNIA. TO FILL THIS GAP AND DEVELOP SCALABLE RESOURCES WITH A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON EXTREME HEAT PLANNING, LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MUST ENGAGE IN COORDINATED ADAPTATION PLANNING THAT INTEGRATES COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVES AND LOCAL PLANNING EXPERTISE. THIS PROJECT WILL USE A COMMUNITY-CENTERED APPROACH TO EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION PLANNING INFORMED BY LOCAL EXPERTS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS WITHIN RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES. RESIDENTS IN THIS REGION, INCLUDING THOSE IN RURAL AND GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED AREAS OF THE COUNTIES, EXPERIENCE BLISTERING SUMMER TEMPERATURES AND ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE TO EXTREME HEAT.

THIS COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FULL FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE AMOUNT OF $999,994.00.

PHASE 1 WILL DEFINE EXTREME HEAT RISKS AND VULNERABILITIES THAT RESONATE WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND IDENTIFY GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADAPTATION STRATEGIES THAT BUILD TOWARDS HOLISTIC PLANNING AND POLICY GUIDANCE FOR EXTREME HEAT. PHASE 2 WILL PRODUCE AN EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDE, IDENTIFY PRIORITIES FOR COMMUNICATION OF THESE RISKS AND ACTIONS, AND DEVELOP CASE STUDY EXAMPLES. IN PHASE 3, THE TEAM WILL LEAD OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE UTILITY OF THESE PLANNING GUIDES FOR DECISION MAKING IN COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IN THE PROCESS, THE TEAM WILL DOCUMENT LESSONS LEARNED AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE USE AND REACH OF EXTREME HEAT PLANNING RESOURCES IN GEOGRAPHIES AND JURISDICTIONS FACING SIMILAR CHALLENGES.

THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES INCLUDE A COMMUNITY-INFORMED, COORDINATED POLICY AND PLAN ALIGNMENT, INTEGRATING WIDE-RANGING PERSPECTIVES ON THE CHALLENGES OF EXTREME HEAT AND ALIGNING WITH CALIFORNIA EXTREME HEAT PLANNING GOALS, IS SIGNIFICANT. THROUGH EVALUATING PROJECT IMPACT AND INFORMING FUTURE OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT PLANS, THIS APPROACH ENHANCES EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION PLANNING AND ACTION. FURTHERMORE, THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THESE PRACTICES TO OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN LEAD TO BROADER ADOPTION OF COMMUNITY-CENTERED ADAPTATION PLANNING. IN PARTICULAR, THE ENHANCED EXTREME HEAT RESILIENCE PLANNING FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES EXEMPLIFIES THE UTILITY AND SCALABILITY OF PARTNERSHIPS FRAMED AROUND BOTTOM-UP COLLABORATIONS. THIS APPROACH NOT ONLY PROVIDES ADAPTATION GUIDANCE RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITIES LACKING CAPACITY TO DEVELOP EXTREME HEAT PLANS, BUT ALSO SERVES AS A MODEL FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY-CENTERED ADAPTATION PLANNING. BY INVOLVING RESIDENTS, CBOS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AND STATE AGENCIES, THIS APPROACH DEMONSTRATES A PROACTIVE AND INCLUSIVE STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF EXTREME HEAT IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.
