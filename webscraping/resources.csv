These temporary injunctions are needed to protect the process of collective bargaining and employee rights under the Act, and to ensure that Board decisions will be meaningful. The section was added as part of a set of reforms to the Act in 1947. Over the years, all NLRB General Counsels have made use of this effective enforcement tool, as shown in this chart.The csv contains Authorization Dates, Case Numbers, Case Names, and Injunction Status as of the date collected (2025-04-07). This list is all 10(j) injunction cases authorized by the Board since September 1, 2010."

Wild birds are the natural reservoirs for these viruses, and active surveillance within wild bird populations provides critical information about viral evolution forming the basis of risk assessments and counter measure development. Unfortunately, active surveillance programs are often resource-intensive, and thus enhancing programs for increased efficiency is paramount. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence applications, provides statistical learning procedures that can be used to gain novel insights into disease surveillance systems. We use a form of machine learning, gradient boosted trees, to estimate the probability of isolating avian influenza viruses (AIV) from wild bird samples collected during surveillance for AIVs from 2006–2011 in the United States. We examined several predictive features including age, sex, bird type, geographic location and matrix gene rrRT-PCR results. Our final model had high predictive power, and only included geographic location and rRT-PCR results as important predictors. The highest predicted viral isolation probability was for samples collected from the north-central states and the south-eastern region of Alaska. Lower rRT-PCR Ct-values are associated with increased likelihood of AIV isolation, and the model estimated 16% probability of isolating AIV from samples declared negative (i.e., ≥ 35 Ct-value) using the rRT-PCR screening test and standard protocols. Our model can be used to prioritize previously collected samples for isolation and rapidly evaluate AIV surveillance designs to maximize the probability of viral isolation given limited resources and laboratory capacity."

The database contains information regarding epicentral coordinates, magnitudes, focal depths, names, and coordinates of reporting cities/ localities, reported intensities, and the distances to the epicenter. Earthquakes listed in the file date from 1638 to 1985. The majority of the felt reports are in the U.S. States and Territories (155,301). Other reporting countries include Antigua and Barbuda (2), Canada (1,364), Mexico (54), Panama (285), and the Philippines (9).Database DescriptionThe Earthquake Intensity File contains more than 157,000 reports on over 20,000 earthquakes that affected the United States from 1638 through 1985. The principal data included for each earthquake are the names and geographic coordinates of the cities/localities that reported effects from earthquakes, (hereafter called ""reporting cities"") and the intensities assigned to those effects. Each intensity has been assigned using the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale of 1931 (Wood and Neumann, 1931). Other information given for each earthquake includes distance of each reporting city from the epicenter of the earthquake; number of hours to subtract from Universal Time (UT) to obtain origin time in local standard time; reference (authority) codes for reporting cities and intensity values, and state codes. In addition, the date, origin time, epicenter, magnitude, and depth (where available) are given for all earthquakes.Although the Earthquake Intensity File represents an important contribution to seismology research, it has several limitations that should be mentionedAbout 25 percent of the 2,500 earthquakes reported from 1638-1928 and 10 percent of the 18,500 events from 1928-1980 do not have instrumental epicenters; this omission is mainly due to the fact that seismological instruments were not developed until the late 1800s, and further that the instruments were not widely distributed for many years later.Several of the reporting cities listed in the file have not been assigned geographic coordinates.The file contains data primarily for those earthquakes that have epicenters in the United States, nearby U.S. territories, and areas of Canada and Mexico that border the United States. Data for a few events in the Philippines (from the late 1930s through 1941) is also included."

Address ranges provide a way of locating homes and businesses based on their street addresses when no other location information is available.Using a house number, street name, street side and ZIP code, address ranges can locate the address to the geographic area associated to that side of the street. Once geocoded, the U.S. Census Bureau can assign the address to a field assignment area or tabulate the data for that address. In addition, academics, researchers, professionals and government agencies outside of the Census Bureau use MAF/TIGER address ranges to transform tabular addresses into geographical datasets for decision-making and analytical purposes.Address ranges must be unique to geocode addresses to the correct location and avoid geocoding conflicts. Multiple elements in MAF/TIGER are required to make an address range unique including street names, address house numbers and street feature geometries, such as street centerlines. The address range data model is designed to maximize geocoding matches with their correct geographic areas in MAF/TIGER by allowing an unlimited number of address range-to-street feature relationships.The Census Bureau’s Geography Division devises numerous operations and processes to build and maintain high quality address ranges so thatAddress ranges accurately describe the location of addresses on the ground.Address All possible city-style addresses are geocoded.Address ranges can handle all known address and street name variations.Address ranges conform with current U.S. Postal Service ZIP codes.Address ranges are reliable and free from conflicts.Automated software continually updates existing address ranges, builds new address ranges and corrects errors. An automated operation links address location points and tabular address information to street feature edges with matching street names in the same block to build and modify address ranges.Many business rules and legal value checks ensure quality address range data in MAF/TIGER. For example, business rules prevent adding or modifying address ranges that overlap another house number range with the same street name and ZIP code. Legal value checks verify that address ranges include mandatory attribute information, valid data types and valid character values.Some of the TIGER/Line products for the public include address ranges and give the public the ability to geocode addresses to MAF/TIGER address ranges for the user’s own purpose. The address range files are available for the nation, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Island Areas at the county level. TIGER/Line files require geographic information system (GIS) software to use.The Census Bureau Geocoder Service is a web service provided to the public. The service accepts up to 1,000 input addresses and, based on Census address ranges, returns the interpolated geocoded location and census geographies. Users can access the service a web interface or a representational state transfer (REST) application program interface (API) web service. See the Census Geocoder for more information on this process.

The dataset includes features of all types in the United States, its associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The dataset holds the federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature classification, and historical and descriptive information. The dataset assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. This dataset is a flat model, establishing no relationships between features, such as hierarchical, spatial, jurisdictional, organizational, administrative, or in any other manner. As an integral part of The National Map, the Gazetteer collects data from a broad program of partnerships with federal, state, and local government agencies and other authorized contributors. The Gazetteer provides data to all levels of government and to the public, as well as to numerous applications through a web query site, web map, feature and XML services, file download services, and customized files upon request.

The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a ""reach code"" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 124,000 (or larger) scale and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1100,000 scale and referred to as medium resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. The NHD is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation, to produce general reference base maps. The National Map download client allows free downloads of public domain NHD data in either Esri File Geodatabase or Shapefile formats.

These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. CDPs must be contained within a single state and may not extend into an incorporated place. There are no population size requirements for CDPs. Hawaii is the only state that has no incorporated places recognized by the Census Bureau. All places shown in decennial census data products for Hawaii are CDPs.

The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of substantial population decline.Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow non-visible legal boundaries, such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations, to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.

They include census county divisions, census subareas, minor civil divisions, and unorganized territories, and can be classified as either legal or statistical. Legal entities are termed minor civil divisions and statistical entities can be either census county divisions, census subareas, or unorganized territories.Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs) are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states (parishes in Louisiana) and of the county equivalents in Puerto Rico and the Island Areas. MCDs in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs include areas variously designated as barrios, barrios-pueblo, boroughs, charter townships, commissioner districts, election districts, election precincts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts, parish governing authority districts, plantations, purchases, reservations, supervisor's districts, towns, and townships. The Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in 29 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and is considered equivalent to an MCD for statistical purposes.In some states, all or some incorporated places are not part of any MCD; these places are termed independent places. In nine states-Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Wisconsin-all incorporated places are independent places. In other states, incorporated places are part of, or dependent within, the MCDs in which they are located, or the pattern is mixed-some incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others are included within one or more MCDs.In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) generally exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as the equivalent of MCDs for purposes of data presentation.In states with legal MCDs, the Census Bureau assigns a default FIPS county subdivision code of 00000 and ANSI code of eight zeroes in some coastal, territorial sea, and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions do not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit.Census County Divisions (CCDs) are areas delineated by the Census Bureau in cooperation with state, tribal, and local officials for statistical purposes. CCDs have no legal function and are not governmental units. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and usually coincide with census tract boundaries. The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location.Census Subareas are statistical subdivisions of boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and census areas, the statistical equivalent entities for counties in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the Census Bureau cooperatively delineate the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs.Unorganized Territories (UTs) are defined by the Census Bureau in nine MCD states where portions of counties or equivalent entities are not included in any legally established MCD or incorporated place. The Census Bureau recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for census purposes. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation ""UT""."

Ocean bottom pressure data also undergo quality control and harmonic analysis at NCEI. The raw data and products are discoverable via the Map, Timelines, and THREDDS Data Server links. Data are provided as netCDF and as gzipped comma-separated-values (CSV). Background InformationIn the 1980s, NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) developed deep ocean tsunameters for the early detection, measurement, and real-time reporting of tsunamis in the open ocean. The PMEL's Project Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART®) developed the tsunameters. A DART® system consists of a seafloor bottom pressure recorder (BPR) capable of detecting tsunamis as small as 1 centimeter, and a moored surface buoy for real-time communications. In 2003, operational responsibility of DART® transitioned from PMEL to the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). There are currently 39 U.S. owned and operated DART® buoys installed throughout the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This completes the current requirements for the DART® array. NOAA has installed DART® systems in the Indian Ocean in partnership with several international organizations (Owned Operated DART Buoys Data Available at NDBC). Upon recovery from the seafloor BPR, 15-second-resolution data undergo quality control and harmonic analysis at NOAA NCEI. Please contact haz.info@noaa.gov if you have questions.

In general, if there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists. If there is an elementary school district, the secondary school district may or may not exist. Administrative school districts were added in 2022 and provide administrative, planning, and educational services for all grade ranges. Currently, the Census Bureau maintains administrative school districts only in Vermont, and they represent supervisory unions and supervisory districts.The Census Bureau categorizes school districts based on the grade ranges for which the school district is financially responsible. These may or may not be the same as the grade ranges that a school district operates. A typical example would be a school district that operates schools for children in grades Kindergarten (KG)-8 and pays a neighboring school district to educate children in grades 9-12. The first school district is operationally responsible for grades KG-8, but financially responsible for grades KG-12. Therefore, the Census Bureau would define the grade range for that school district as KG-12. If an elementary school district is financially responsible for grades KG-12 or Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12, there will be no secondary school district represented for that area. In cases, where an elementary school district is financially responsible for only lower grades, there is generally a secondary school district that is financially responsible for providing educational services for the upper grades."

The Ferry Terminals dataset represents all ferry terminals from operators that provided responses to the 2020 National Census of Ferry Operators. Areas covered by the dataset include the 50 states as well as the territories of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Island, and American Samoa. The terminals represent departure and arrival locations for ferry segments in the NCFO. As part of the NCFO questionnaire, respondents were asked terminal name, city, and state. From this information, longitude and latitudes were obtained through open, online searches that include operator websites and map platforms such as Google Maps and Open Street Maps. As a result, termina sometimes do not represent the exact location where ferry vessels dock but may represent other locations such as the operator’s business location or alternative docking locations. However, whenever possible, the terminal locations represent departure and arrival points for that ferry segment. Each terminal contains information about its operation and ownership status, in addition to geographic location and transportation connections, whenever operators provided this information."

Those areas may be proposed for designation as “critical habitat.” Critical habitat is a term defined and used in the Act. It is a specific geographic area(s) that contains features essential for the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and that may require special management and protection. Critical habitat may include an area that is not currently occupied by the species but that will be needed for its recovery. An area is designated as “critical habitat” after the Service publishes a proposed Federal regulation in the Federal Register and receives and considers public comments on the proposal. The final boundaries of the critical habitat are also published in the Federal Register. Critical habitat are areas considered essential for the conservation of a listed species. Federal agencies are required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on actions they carry out, fund, or authorize to ensure that their actions will not destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. These areas provide notice to the public and land managers of the importance of these areas to the conservation of a listed species. Special protections and/or restrictions are possible in areas where Federal funding, permits, licenses, authorizations, or actions occur or are required."

The GIS data and services are designed to provide the user with the ability to determine the flood zone, base flood elevation, and floodway status for a particular location. It also has information about the NFIP communities, map panels, cross sections, hydraulic structures, Coastal Barrier Resource System, and base maps such as road, stream, and public land survey data. Through flood studies, FEMA produces Flood Insurance Study Reports, FIRM Panels, and FIRM Databases. FIRM Databases that become effective are incorporated into the NFHL. Updates to the NFHL are issued through Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs) and Letters of Map Amendment (LOMAs). Continuously updated, the NFHL serves as a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map representing the current effective flood data for those communities where maps have been digitized. NFHL data can be viewed with widely available GIS software, including freely available programs that work with GIS shapefiles. For more information on the NFHL, see the online resources referenced herein. Using base maps The minimum horizontal positional accuracy for base map hydrographic and transportation features used with the NFHL is the NSSDA radial accuracy of 38 feet. Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) point locations are approximate. The location of the LOMA is referenced in the legal description of the letter itself.

The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a ""reach code"" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 124,000 (or larger) scale and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1100,000 scale and referred to as medium resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. The NHD is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation, to produce general reference base maps. The National Map download client allows free downloads of public domain NHD data in either Esri File Geodatabase or Shapefile formats. For additional information on the NHD, go to https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset.

(Excerpted from the National Incident Management System) The Government Provided Information (GPI) source for this layer contains State and Federal Emergency Operations Centers in addition to local Emergency Operations Centers. This dataset contains Federal and local Emergency Operation Centers and only those federal centers that are of a local nature such as military installations. In cases where an Emergency Operations Center has a mobile unit, TechniGraphics captured the location of the mobile unit as a separate record. This record represents where the mobile unit is stored and if the location could not be verified, a point was placed in the approximate center of the Emergency Operations Centers service area. TechniGraphics tried to verify whether or not each Emergency Operations Center has a generator on-site and whether or not the Emergency Operations Center is located in a basement. This information is indicated by the values in the [GENERATOR] and [BASEMENT] fields respectively. In cases where more than one record existed for a geographical area (e.g., county, city), TechniGraphics verified whether or not one of the records represented an alternate location. This was indicated by appending ""-ALTERNATE"" to the value in the [NAME] field. Some Emergency Operations Centers are located at private residences. The [TYPE] field was manually evaluated during the delivery process to compare the records in which the [NAME] field contained ""-ALTERNATE"". In cases where these values contradicted information that was verified by TechniGraphics (e.g. [NAME] contained ""- ALTERNATE"" and [TYPE] = ""PRIMARY""), the value in the [TYPE] field was changed to match the type indicated by the [NAME] of the verified record. TechniGraphics did not change values in this field if the type was not verified. Records with ""-Department of Defense (DOD)"" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

By 1982, the NID included 68,153 dam records gathered from dam inspections, extensive record searches, and some feature extraction from aerial imagery. These NID databases were available on diskettes and compact discs.In the late 1990s, the NID was transitioned to a web-based platform and viewing the data on a map. Gathering data on dams also transitioned during this time - the most accurate data was now coming from states, territories, and federal agencies. This transition aligned with the establishment of the National Dam Safety Program.Information Available in the NIDSince transitioning to a web-based platform, site visitors have been able to download or export certain data. The NID is currently the only place to find and download national data at such a detailed level.Today, the database contains information for more than 91,000 dams that meet the following criteriaDams where a failure or mis-operation will likely result in loss of human life (high hazard potential).Dams where a failure or mis-operation would likely result in disruption of access to critical facilities, damage to public and private facilities, and require difficult mitigation efforts (significant hazard potential).Dams that meet minimum height and reservoir size requirements, even though they do not pose the same level of life or economic risk as those above – these dams are equal to or exceed 25 feet in height and exceed 15 acre-feet in storage, or equal to or exceeding 50 acre-feet in storage and exceeding 6 feet in height.The NID does not yet contain all dams in the U.S. that meet these criteria. Continued, routine updates to the NID and enhanced data collection efforts, focused on the most reliable data sources (primarily the many federal and state government dam regulatory programs), will help capture these dams and result in a more robust dataset over time.National Inventory of DamsContact NID at NID@usace.army.mil"

The dataset holds the federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature classification, and historical and descriptive information. The dataset assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. This dataset is a flat model, establishing no relationships between features, such as hierarchical, spatial, jurisdictional, organizational, administrative, or in any other manner.

The outer limit of each of these zones is measured from the U.S. normal baseline, which coincides with the low water line depicted on NOAA charts and includes closing lines across the entrances of legal bays and rivers, consistent with international law. The U.S. baseline and associated maritime limits are reviewed and approved through the interagency U.S. Baseline Committee, which is chaired by the U.S. Department of State. The Committee serves the function of gaining interagency consensus on the proper location of the baseline using the provisions of the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, to ensure that the seaward extent of U.S. maritime zones do not exceed the breadth that is permitted by international law. In 2002 and in response to mounting requests for digital maritime zones, NOAA launched a project to re-evaluate the U.S. baseline in partnership with other federal agencies via the U.S. Baseline Committee. The focus of the baseline evaluation was NOAA's largest scale, most recent edition nautical charts as well as supplemental source materials for verification of certain charted features. This dataset is a result of the 2002-present initiative and reflects a multi-year iterative project whereby the baseline and associated maritime limits were re-evaluated on a state or regional basis.

The highly adaptable and effective system of barge navigation moves over 625 million tons of commodities annually, which includes coal, petroleum products, various other raw materials, food and farm products, chemicals, and manufactured goods. The shallow draft waterways have many unique characteristics and difficulties over coastal harbor and ocean navigation; river levels can change by over 30 feet in a seasonal cycle, the navigation channel can shift significantly within the river banks, and shifting yet ever present river currents pose constant challenges in these confined waterways. Electronic chart systems can offer significant benefits to vessels including accurate and real-time display of vessel position relative to waterway features, voyage planning and monitoring, training tools for new personnel and integrated display of river charts, radar, and Automatic Identification Systems. Following recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board, the National Academy of Science and the American Waterways Operators, Congress directed the Corps of Engineers to develop and publish electronic charts for the inland waterways. Development of Inland Electronic Navigational Charts (IENCs) to cover the Mississippi River and tributaries thus began in 2001 with pilot projects on the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana and Lower Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi. These projects, which involved a combination of in-house and contract activities, were the first efforts to collect and convert inland waterway data, commonly used for river and channel maintenance, into the international S-57 hydrographic data exchange.

The dataset assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. This dataset is a flat model, establishing no relationships between features, such as hierarchical, spatial, jurisdictional, organizational, administrative, or in any other manner.

Ocean bottom pressure data also undergo quality control and harmonic analysis at NCEI. The raw data and products are discoverable via the Map, Timelines, and THREDDS Data Server links. Data are provided as netCDF and as gzipped comma-separated-values (CSV). Background InformationIn the 1980s, NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) developed deep ocean tsunameters for the early detection, measurement, and real-time reporting of tsunamis in the open ocean. The PMEL's Project Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART®) developed the tsunameters. A DART® system consists of a seafloor bottom pressure recorder (BPR) capable of detecting tsunamis as small as 1 centimeter, and a moored surface buoy for real-time communications. In 2003, operational responsibility of DART® transitioned from PMEL to the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). There are currently 39 U.S. owned and operated DART® buoys installed throughout the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This completes the current requirements for the DART® array. NOAA has installed DART® systems in the Indian Ocean in partnership with several international organizations (Owned Operated DART Buoys Data Available at NDBC). Upon recovery from the seafloor BPR, 15-second-resolution data undergo quality control and harmonic analysis at NOAA NCEI. Please contact haz.info@noaa.gov if you have questions.

The National Map Gazetteer contains information about physical and cultural geographic features, geographic areas, and locational entities that are generally recognizable and locatable by name (have achieved some landmark status) and are of interest to any level of government or to the public for any purpose that would lead to the representation of the feature in printed or electronic maps and/or geographic information systems. The dataset includes features of all types in the United States, its associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The dataset holds the federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature classification, and historical and descriptive information. The dataset assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. This dataset is a flat model, establishing no relationships between features, such as hierarchical, spatial, jurisdictional, organizational, administrative, or in any other manner. As an integral part of The National Map, the Gazetteer collects data from a broad program of partnerships with federal, state, and local government agencies and other authorized contributors. The Gazetteer provides data to all levels of government and to the public, as well as to numerous applications through a web query site, web map, feature and XML services, file download services, and customized files upon request.

The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels annually from state education officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children aged 5 through 17 in families in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districtsThe Census Bureau tabulates data for four types of school districts elementary, secondary, unified, and administrative. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are the local education agency number assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name.Unified school districts provide education to children of all school ages. In general, if there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists. If there is an elementary school district, the secondary school district may or may not exist. Administrative school districts were added in 2022 and provide administrative, planning, and educational services for all grade ranges. Currently, the Census Bureau maintains administrative school districts only in Vermont, and they represent supervisory unions and supervisory districts.The Census Bureau categorizes school districts based on the grade ranges for which the school district is financially responsible. These may or may not be the same as the grade ranges that a school district operates. A typical example would be a school district that operates schools for children in grades Kindergarten (KG)-8 and pays a neighboring school district to educate children in grades 9-12. The first school district is operationally responsible for grades KG-8, but financially responsible for grades KG-12. Therefore, the Census Bureau would define the grade range for that school district as KG-12. If an elementary school district is financially responsible for grades KG-12 or Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12, there will be no secondary school district represented for that area. In cases, where an elementary school district is financially responsible for only lower grades, there is generally a secondary school district that is financially responsible for providing educational services for the upper grades.Download https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TGRGDB24/tlgdb_2024_a_us_school.gdb.zip Layer School_District_UnifiedMetadata https://meta.geo.census.gov/data/existing/decennial/GEO/GPMB/TIGERline/Current_19115/series_tl_2023_unsd.shp.iso.xml"

Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature classification, and historical and descriptive information. The dataset assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. This dataset is a flat model, establishing no relationships between features, such as hierarchical, spatial, jurisdictional, organizational, administrative, or in any other manner.

The Service broadcasts correction signals on marine radiobeacon frequencies to improve the accuracy and integrity to GPS-derived positions. The Coast Guard DGPS Service provides 10-meter accuracy in all established coverage areas. Typically, the position error of a DGPS position is 1 to 3 meters, greatly enhancing harbor entrance and approach navigation. The System provides service for coastal coverage of the continental U.S., the Great Lakes, Puerto Rico, portions of Alaska, Hawaii, and a large part of the Mississippi River Basin. Many foreign nations are implementing standard DGPS services modeled after the U.S. Coast Guard?s system to improve maritime safety in their critical waterways. The Coast Guard's maritime Differential Global Positioning Service achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) on 15 March 1999 as announced in the DOT press release. The maritime DGPS service provides 10 meter (2 dRMS) navigation accuracy, integrity alarms for GPS and DGPS out-of-tolerance conditions within 10 seconds of detection, availability of 99.7% per month, coastal coverage to the continental United States, the Great Lakes, Puerto Rico/US Virgin Islands, and selected portions of Alaska and Hawaii. The achievement of FOC culminates a six-year effort to convert existing radiobeacon sites and construct new sites to transmit DGPS corrections. Several equipment upgrades were installed to improve system performance. During the procurement and installation phases of the system upgrades, the maritime DGPS service operated under Initial Operational Capability rules, where the signals provided accurate corrections with integrity to the maximum extent possible."

However, our current ability to understand landslide hazards at the national scale is limited, in part because spatial data on landslide occurrence across the U.S. varies greatly in quality, accessibility, and extent. Landslide inventories are typically collected and maintained by different agencies and institutions, usually within specific jurisdictional boundaries, and often with varied objectives and information attributes or even in disparate formats. The purpose of this data release is to provide an openly accessible, centralized map of existing information about landslide occurrence across the entire U.S. This data release is an update of previous versions 1 (Jones and others, 2019) and 2 (Belair and others, 2022). Changes relative to version 2 are summarized in us_ls_v3_changes.txt. It provides an integrated database of the landslides from these inventories (refer to US_Landslide_v3_gpkg) with a selection of uniform attributes, including links to the original digital inventory files (whenever available) (“Inv_URL”). The data release includes digital inventories created by both USGS and non-USGS authors. The original inventory is denoted by an abbreviation in the “Inventory” attribute. The full citation for each abbreviation can be found in us_ls_v3_references.csv. The date of the landslide event is included as a minimum and maximum (“Date_Min” and “Date_Max”) to accommodate events that happen within a range of dates. The date value is inherently difficult to interpret or discern due to the nature of landsliding, where some landslides move for long periods of time or move intermittently, and some areas can exhibit multiple landslide events. To preserve the constituent inventories as much as possible, we include all entries even if they are not considered landslides, such as “gullies” or “avalanche chutes.” We include a landslide type attribute when that information is available (“LS_Type”). The landslide classification system used in the original inventories is not always known or stated in the metadata, but many mapping entities use the schema from Cruden and Varnes (1996) or the updated schema from Hungr and others (2014). Given the wide range of landslide information sources in this data compilation, we provide an attribute to assess the relative confidence in the characterization of the location and extent of each landslide (entry) (“Confidence”). The confidence level reflects the resolution and quality of input data, as well as the method used for identification and mapping. This confidence does not reflect a formal accuracy assessment of field attributes. Relative to the previous data releases (version 1 and 2), this update (v3) includes more inventories, updated confidence rules, a new landslide type attribute, a new unique identifier (“USGS_ID”), new machine-readable date fields, and an ancillary database containing all fields from the original inventories (refer to US_Landslide_v3_ancillary).

The outer limit of each of these zones is measured from the U.S. normal baseline, which coincides with the low water line depicted on NOAA charts and includes closing lines across the entrances of legal bays and rivers, consistent with international law. The U.S. baseline and associated maritime limits are reviewed and approved through the interagency U.S. Baseline Committee, which is chaired by the U.S. Department of State. The Committee serves the function of gaining interagency consensus on the proper location of the baseline using the provisions of the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, to ensure that the seaward extent of U.S. maritime zones do not exceed the breadth that is permitted by international law. In 2002 and in response to mounting requests for digital maritime zones, NOAA launched a project to re-evaluate the U.S. baseline in partnership with other federal agencies via the U.S. Baseline Committee. The focus of the baseline evaluation was NOAA's largest scale, most recent edition nautical charts as well as supplemental source materials for verification of certain charted features. This dataset is a result of the 2002-present initiative and reflects a multi-year iterative project whereby the baseline and associated maritime limits were re-evaluated on a state or regional basis. In addition to the U.S. maritime limits, the U.S. maritime boundaries with opposite or adjacent countries as well as the US/Canada International Boundary (on land and through the Great Lakes) are also included in this dataset.

It should not include planned and suspended (non-operational) sites and mobile clinics. These definitions were set by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Policy Board in December 1998 and are the basis for defining the category and the additional service types for each VHA service site. These definitions cover sites generally owned by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the exception of leased and contracted community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). 1. VA HOSPITAL an institution (health care site) that is owned, staffed and operated by VA and whose primary function is to provide inpatient services. NOTE Each geographically unique inpatient division of an integrated facility is counted as a separate hospital. 2. VA RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION TREATMENT PROGRAM (RRTP) provides comprehensive health and social services in a VA facility for eligible veterans who are ambulatory and do not require the level of care provided in nursing homes. 3. VA NURSING HOME CARE UNITS (NHCU) provides care to individuals who are not in need of hospital care, but who require nursing care and related medical or psychosocial services in an institutional setting. VA NHCUs are facilities designed to care for patients who require a comprehensive care management system coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. Services provided include nursing, medical, rehabilitative, recreational, dietetic, psychosocial, pharmaceutical, radiological, laboratory, dental and spiritual. 4. VA OUTPATIENT CLINICS a. Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) a VA-operated, VA-funded, or VA-reimbursed health care facility or site geographically distinct or separate from a parent medical facility. This term encompasses all types of VA outpatient clinics, except hospital-based, independent and mobile clinics. Satellite, community-based, and outreach clinics have been redefined as CBOCs. Technically, CBOCs fall into four Categories, which are > (i) VA-owned. A CBOC that is owned and staffed by VA. > (ii) Leased. A CBOC where the space is leased (contracted), but is staffed by VA. NOTE This includes donated space staffed by VA. > (iii) Contracted. A CBOC where the space and the staff are not VA. This is typically a Healthcare Management Organization (HMO)-type provided where multiple sites can be associated with a single station identifier. > (iv) Not Operational. A CBOC which has been approved by Congress, but has not yet begun operating. b. Hospital-Based Outpatient Clinic outpatient clinic functions located at a hospital. c. Independent Outpatient Clinic a full-time, self-contained, freestanding, ambulatory care clinic that has no management, program, or fiscal relationship to a VA medical facility. Primary and specialty health care services are provided in an outpatient setting. 5. VET CENTER Provides professional readjustment counseling, community education, outreach to special populations, brokering of services with community agencies, and access to links between the veteran and VA. 6. VA MEDICAL CENTER (VAMC) a medical center is a unique VA site of care providing two or more types of services that reside at a single physical site location. The services provided are the primary service as tracked in the VHA Site Tracking (VAST) (i.e., VA Hospital, Nursing Home, Domiciliary, independent outpatient clinic (IOC), hospital-based outpatient clinic (HBOC), and CBOC). The definition of VA medical center does not include the Vet Centers as an identifying service. This dataset is based upon GFI data received from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.

States participating in the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program provided the Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs. Each VTD is identified by a one-to six-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county. The code ""ZZZZZZ"" identifies a portion of counties (usually bodies of water) for which no VTDs were identified. For 2010 Census, only Kentucky and Rhode Island did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs exist in these states for 2010 Census data products. In two other states - Montana and Oregon - not all counties have voting districts defined. Participating states often submitted VTDs conforming to the feature network in the MAF/TIGER database rather than the complete legal boundary of the VTD. If requested by the participating state, the Census Bureau identified the VTDs that represent an actual voting district with an ""A"" in the voting district indicator field. Where a participating state indicated that the VTD has been modified to follow existing features, the VTD is a pseudo-VTD, and the voting district indicator contains ""P.""

For more information on the NFHL, see the online resources referenced herein. Using base maps The minimum horizontal positional accuracy for base map hydrographic and transportation features used with the NFHL is the NSSDA radial accuracy of 38 feet. Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) point locations are approximate. The location of the LOMA is referenced in the legal description of the letter itself. LOMA points can be viewed in the NFHL Interactive Map on the FEMA GeoPlatform."

Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. This dataset represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the 12-digit for the entire United States. Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 124,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 125,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 163,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries were developed where partners and data existed and were incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit.

Sample material is available directly from each repository. Before proposing research on any sample, please contact the repository’s curator for sample condition and availability.Each repository submits data gleaned from physical samples to the IMLGS database, which is maintained by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). All sample data include basic collection and storage information, whereas some samples, at the discretion of the curator, may also include lithology, texture, age, mineralogy, weathering, metamorphism, glass remarks, color, physiographic province, principal investigator, and/or descriptive information. The public can access the IMLGS database by using NOAA NCEI’s data access resources."

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) developed a model that allows for Census tract estimation using the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data along with American Community Survey (ACS) data from the Census Bureau. The model divides the NHTS data into six geographic areas, classifies these areas as urban/suburban/rural, and then estimates average weekday household person miles traveled, person trips, vehicle miles traveled, and vehicle trips for each geographic area. The BTS model then transfers the estimates to individual Census tracts using the household and demographic data from the ACS for each Census tract.The resulting Census tract estimates provide beneficial indicators to local governments and other customers who may not have the budget and/or time for conducting their own local survey. Additionally, the use of a standard set of questions across all geographies in the NHTS enables comparison across geographies that otherwise would be captured in dcensus tracts with zero population, or census tracts with very unusual demographic or travel characteristics."

Also, NCAP conducts advanced driver assistance system tests to determine how well the system avoids a crash. CrashworthinessTest data obtained from the crashworthiness and rollover tests are used to generate safety ratings for each vehicle, which are included on a label required to be placed on each new vehicle at the point of sale. A rating of five stars indicates the highest safety rating, whereas a one star indicates the lowest rating.Crash AvoidanceData collected from the program’s crash avoidance tests are used to provide safety technology recommendations based on system performance. The star ratings information and safety technology recommendations provide consumers with important vehicle safety information to help them make informed purchasing decisions. All tests are conducted under controlled conditions at laboratories contracted by NHTSA."
